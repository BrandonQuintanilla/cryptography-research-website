Verifiable delay functions are a core building block to the Eth2 infrastructure. They assume the existence of a deterministic function $f$ such that $f(x) = y$ takes at least time $t$ to compute. They further require a short proof $\pi$ attesting to the fact that $f(x)$ has been computed correctly. This is to allow for fast verification.
