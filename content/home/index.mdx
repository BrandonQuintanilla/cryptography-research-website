# Welcome to Cryptography Research at the Ethereum Foundation

The Ethereum Foundation leads research into cryptographic protocols that are useful within the greater Ethereum community and more generally.  Cryptography is a key tool that enables greater functionality, security, efficiency, and auditability in decentralized settings.  We are currently conducting research into verifiable delay functions, multiparty computation, vector commitments, and zero-knowledge proofs etc.  We have a culture of open source and no patents are put on any work that we produce.
